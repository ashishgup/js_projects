Good vfm headphones but still a lot of room for improvement
ByLight Yagamion March 6, 2018
Color: Black|Verified Purchase
The headphones are extremely well made and sturdy.
Extremely good sound and stereo seperation.
The vocals are very clear, instruments can be distinguished and good amount of bass is present.
Received them on May 3rd.
The ANC works reasonably well.
The headband over the head even at maximum extension is a bit short which might be problematic for people with big heads.
The headphones are a bit heavy but the ear pads are extremely plush and removable.
If they can reduce the weight and increase the headband extension a bit more to suit people off all head sizes it would be the best.
Also, a bit more padding on the headband would make it perfect.
Can't expect too much for 150 dollars but will worth the price.

5.0 out of 5 starsBeautifully packaged, terrific sound quality
ByM.Baltimoreon March 27, 2018

Beautifully packaged, terrific sound quality, very good noise canceling, and truly attractive & comfortable around the ears. My only complaint is the headphones are a little heavy and feel uncomfortable at the top of my head after a while. I think some extra padding and/or a decrease in overall weight would resolve this issue. I still give it 5 stars because I feel this is an excellent set of headphones for the price and the quality. Buy them!

5.0 out of 5 starsWow! These are Fantastic!
ByMikeon April 13, 2018
Color: Silver|Verified Purchase
 I have used a number of headsets over the past several years and these are hands down the best of them all. The sound quality is absolutely incredible, especially for wireless. These rival the best and the most expensive in the business, at a fraction of the cost.

I own 2 other pairs of Cowin headphones and I have been pleased with both of them but the E8 blows them out of the water. The bass is the most improved from the E7 and is now rich and deep.

The noise cancelation function is absolutely phenomenal. We have quite a loud vent in the office I share at work and my coworker and I kept switching these headphones, amazed that the sound of the vent completely faded away.

They come nicely packaged and even include a nice hardshell case. The only thing that I would have changed about this product was to include a handle on the case to make it a little easier to carry.

These headphones are more expensive than some of the other brands available to purchase here but the price to value relationship for these is absolutely incredible. I would recommend these even without the active noise cancelation function for the sound quality alone. Considering the quality of the noise cancelation, these are a bargain. Strongly Recommended!

5.0 out of 5 stars4.5 stars
ByHawk eyeTop Contributor: Guitarson March 23, 2018

I used a pair of Plantronics BackBeat Pro headphones for years. I work in an industrial area so excess noise is highly prevalent. I do my job at a workbench, away from all the heavy dangerous machinery though, so I'm allowed to use headphones so long as I remove them when I step away from my workbench.

The BBP's were awesome. My music sounded great through them, the noise cancelling was effective; It cut out a lot of background noise but I could still hear and understand human voices. My only gripe about the BBP's was they had a sensor that would stop your music if you removed the headphones. I don't have a very round head so if I turned my head, the BBP's would cut off my music. This got worse as the headphones aged. Then began my search to find a suitable replacement.....

These Cowin E8's are it! They fit like the BBP's, sound just as good if not better, AND the noise cancellation is even better on the E8's than the BBP's! I can hear human voices while wearing these E8's, but I can't understand what the voice is saying; I have to remove one earmuff to be able to understand what someone is saying to me. One that note (pun intended), these E8's don't have the annoying sensor to stop music playback like the BBP's do, so although I do weaken the noise cancelling when I turn my head due to the headphones' ear muffs losing vacuum seal against my head, it's nice to have my music keep playing.

So why four and a half stars?

The button controls on the E8's are unstable. Sometimes, especially if I switch media on my phone (For example, watch a video on YouTube on my break, then restart the music player app [I use Pi Music Player]), the power button, which doubles as a pause button for music playback, doesn't work properly. It won't pause my music, and the function to initiate a call based on the last number you dialed is extremely annoying. I have to turn off and restart the headphones and even reset the Bluetooth on my phone. I didn't have this issue with my old BBP's. Moving to the volume/track skipping buttons, it's a slight learning curve on timing your button presses correctly to make them do what you want them to.

So I'd like to see the E8's get revised with more buttons with dedicated functions. Irritating as the multi-purpose buttons are though, I still really enjoy these headphones and hope they last for many years like my old BackBeat Pro's did.

Definitely a new experience. I only ever wear gaming headphones like razer and Corsair products. But these are pretty good. The noise dampening mode makes me feel dizzy but I googled it and that’s normal, and it passes after awhile. Overall pretty great, I’d definitely recommend. I’d buy another pair as a gift if they weren’t so pricy though! But it is great quality. Comes with a case too.

5.0 out of 5 starsNICE!
ByRichard D. Bradfordon March 30, 2018
Color: Black|Verified Purchase
Wow. ....

Okay, I JUST put these on for the first time after a full charge. Connected via BT to my LGV20. Listening to DI.fm.

Wow. ......... .......

My Wife <3 tried my 1.5 year old E7 headset for the first time 5 days ago. The ANC allowed her to sit next to me; to enjoy her music while I watched a movie. Then she wanted her own pair. But, of course my dear!

I logged onto my favorite go-to site. Found the E7's and noticed the 'deal'. Get the E8's for 2*E7=price AND get an E7 discount! (also picked up the Amazon CC offer for the extra 5% plus $80 gift) Best deal in a long time. The Wifey got her new white E7's and......

So there's no comparison. I have all kinds of headsets laying around I just got annoyed with over time, even the E7... 'sad'. But, explains why Wifey got to use them. Now it's all coming together. I'll make this novel a short story. Or a poem... hmmmmm.

Boots n pants, boots n pants
I'm a rockin' , you've got two new fans!

Had "Trumped" all the 'best' headsets
And expected to add one more.
I was in the zone of accepting average
But a shock was in my store!

Someone told me the E7 was the one to beat
So I took the bet and had to accept defeat

He was good, real good so to a new level he was raised
He was so good in the beginning he then had to be praised.
But in a few weeks or after a while (I'm not sure anymore)
I threw " Embarrassment7 " right out the door. -you know E7 E=embarrassment

What a waste I heard some people say

To spend so much time and money on something so useless
I explained, my ears wouldn't take it after just a few uses.
My dreams had shown me what I needed was near
And I needed to seek out the best of the gear!

Don't get in my way, I'm doing the Lord's work
He's lazy right now and watching Miley Cyrus doing the ...
...twerk

After all these long years my dream manefested
So much typing here my fingers need to be rested
However though, I had completely forgot
The new E8 had arrived and where did I... find it I could not

Well I'd write a review of how comfortable he is
But he's suddenly lost and I'm getting a little pissed
So, now I'm off on another mission elsewhere
You see, there's this loud music coming from somewhere...

The E8's are crisp and clear. Sooo much better over the ears too.

Oh, look, I found them!

RIP USA

5.0 out of 5 starsSolid headphones with very good active noise cancelation
ByJoe Ton April 22, 2018
Color: Black|Verified Purchase
 First of all, its comes up with a perfect packing - which is covered with a beautiful hard case that protects the headphones from any damage
when its put inside your cabin or check-in baggage. Coming to the cables and accessories - it comes up Airplane adapter, AUX cable, micro USB charging cable, etc. All these are put inside a velvet pouch. All these accessories gets you started quickly. Connecting it to your device is easy and quick. I am upgrading from the successful COWIN E7 to E8 - When comparing between these two -
From build perspective - its little sturdier and ear pads also nice and big. From earpad cushion - its well padded for a longer hours of listening.
Coming to the important stuff i.e, Sound Quality - I can feel the difference in the improved sound quality and Active Noise cancellation from E7 to E8.
Battery Life has improved a lot as well. But, when you compare Bose products with Cowin, for the price range that we are paying for E8, it satisfies in all aspects of sound, build, accessories and solid case.
I definitely recommend this product.

Headphone not bad. Audio is definitely better than E7 but the bass is much weaker than E7.

4.0 out of 5 starsGood buy
ByFrank Bellon April 3, 2018
Color: Black|Verified Purchase
Used them for an hour, first time. Sound quality is very good, ANR works well. I'll use them at the gym, and while mowing. The ability to input via bluetooth or a conventional cord is great. Bigger and heavier than the Bose equivalent (but $200 cheaper!) Only real complaint: the clamping pressure is a bit high... that is, after an your, your head feels like it's been squeezed. That of course improves the noise reduction, though at some cost in comfort. (Wish there were an adjustment for this). Overall, I'm pleased with them, and recommend them as a cost effective buy, though not top of the line. You'd have to pay a lot more to get a small improvement.

The ear cups were super soft and fit snugly around my ears. Battery life and Bluetooth range were around what was described. The sound was great, very smooth with deep bass and clear mids. Overall I am highly satisfied with this pair, and would definitely recommend them.

Keep in mind that this review is for a sub $200 headset with noise cancelation. In this regards, it is a really good set. It is well constructed and sounds good. If you are not willing to drop $400 on a headset with noise cancelation, but you'll drop $150ish, this set will make you happy. The noise cancelation piece of it is very good. It was eerie going from hearing EVERYTHING at the office to nothing... But it was also nice that I was able to focus more and get more work done. I'm including a link to the product incase this review gets mixed into reviews for other products. This is happening too much...

While the E8's lack the bass punch of the E7's, the clarity is fantastic, and I am hearing instrumentation that I previously missed with said E7's.
I would say for those who upgrade to the E8's, that might complain about the lack of bass, my advice is to use the equalizer on their cellphones and computers.
Other than that, and the somewhat odd sized audio plug, going into the headphones, these are superior headphones in their price range, and I gladly recommend them to friends and family.

What can I say? I love these? When I first put them on - I did not realize there was a switch to cancel sound. I thought - well, they are okay. And then one day, I hit a noise cancelling button by accident and it got really quiet. I said "Wow!" I wear them when I work in the yard and also inside my house. They are great for the money! You have to remember to charge 8 hours in the beginning before wearing them. And charge between wearing if you wear like I do - the entire day.

ByAmazon Customeron May 1, 2018
Color: Black|Verified Purchase
I do not normally write reviews but buyers need be aware that the plastic connecting the phones to the headband is brittle and WILL break and become irreparable -- it's only a matter of time; look for other similar reviews. Luckily, mine broke in the second week so I still expect a refund. If they broke six months or a year later, I'd be upset at the $150 price. All that being said....I really wanted to love these; they sounded great for about two weeks.....

The product is working great. Solid sound quality and great ANC for the price. Bluetooth would connect with no issues. Battery life and range are also well above my needs. Some critiques however, the bass is a little weak compared to other headphones of the same price range, and the package was received missing the charging cable and the aux with the 2.5. mm end as well as airplane adapter. Suggestion to perhaps make all aux inputs in the future the more universal 3.5 mm type, being that it was very difficult to find a 2.5 aux in stores, Had to order online. Customer support was great clearing up the complaints and issues I had experienced.

Two weeks ago I purchased a Cowin E8 headphone. It arrived quickly and I charged it and began listening! The unit was easy to pair to my tablet, the sound quality is great (!) and I was very happy! The Active Noise Cancellation worked fabulously. Unfortunately, the headband broke after 9 days use, just near one ear cup pivot. Just a one off defect in my particular headband's plastic, I believe. Anyway, I contacted support@cowinaudio.com by email and the following morning I had the nicest email I have ever received from any manufacturer servicing my warranty claim in my inbox!! They apologized for the defect and immediately gave me a special code in order toreceive a replacement headset from Amazon free of charge. So nice to receive such immediate and personal customer support and a quick fix to my issue! I can highly recommend the E8 Active Noise Cancelling headphones and above all the Cowin customer support!! I will be buying other Cowin products in the future. My new headphone will be here tomorrow!!

Color: Black|Verified Purchase
I've had bluetooth headphones before, but they've always seemed subpar.
The range on these headphones is EXCELLENT, the sound quality is absolutely crystal clear, and the noise cancelling actually works quite well. I wore them recently on several flights, and the noise cancelling allowed me to really enjoy my music and podcasts.
The hard travel case is also a huge positive. It's really well-made and incredibly convenient when travelling with them. I don't have to worry about them getting banged up inside my backpack!
The only issues I've had so far are that they ARE pretty bulky, and part of the plastic headband near where the speaker pivot joint is has cracked on both sides, but these are honestly really minor.

2.0 out of 5 starsMIC feature is not improved and not worth paying $150 when the next step down is equally as good in quality and sound.
ByRuskiion March 31, 2018
Color: Black|Verified Purchase
I bout these as an option to use at home and at work for the purpose of listening to music with the ANC feature to block out the environment and also to easily utilize the phone feature so as to not have to take the headphones off an on.

I have used the E7, which I love how they fit once I was accustomed to wearing them, but the MIC was not good at all and didn't work.

When I received these, the first thing that jumped out was their size. They are big, bulky, and feel heavier. The Mic feature didn't work any better than the E7 version. So I am returning these.

The reason for the TWO starts is because Cowin really makes a good product over all. The sound quality and distance allowable for the headphones to work is amazing. Purchasing the E7 Pro 2018 version with hopes that the MIC is fixed. If not, then at this point I will just use them as a premium headphone option until I decide which headphones to go with next.

ByAngelo Wongon May 12, 2018

Love the packaging and music sounds great. The phone call quality is maybe a 7/10 but workable. The headphones are a bit tight after a while. The ANC I initially thought was "OK" but actually pretty good. When I take my headphones off things are a lot louder, showing how great the ANC actually is. Probably not as great as a QC35 but still, very workable for a $150 headphone.
